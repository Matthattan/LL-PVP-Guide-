The standard for competitive battles is level 50, this means 8 Training Points (or 4 if they’re in Energy) and 2 Unique Points are equal to 1 total stat point. </li><li>Try not to force a Loomian to take on multiple roles. Though it&#39;s important that your team gets the utility it needs to perform well, You may end up stretching its entire arsenal utilities so thin that it can’t perform any of its roles well. Instead, try to focus on a singular role. </li><li> Create purposeful sets by justifying your investments; consider a Loomian&#39;s base stats and movepool. Avoid vague reasoning like &quot;to tank hits.&quot; You can use the damage calculator to simulate matchups, ensuring optimal point investment for survival, outspeeding, or achieving knockouts. </li><li>Understand how a role affects Training Points, Personalities, Item, Moveset etc. An offensive role such as a Cleaner is likely to invest a lot into its dominant attacking stat and speed however a Wall would prefer maximizing its health and defenses. Many Loomians have explicitly high stats which make it easier to understand how it can be used within the competitive scene. </li><li> Analyze the meta - by understanding which Loomians are being used the most and others which are not seeing usage, you can evaluate if your choices for set making are valid. If you were in a meta with lots of offensive water types, would making a defensive set for a fire type be worth it? </li><li>Test your sets out - simulators are pretty powerful tools however they can’t substitute the real thing. There may be a matchup you forgot to check or an investment simply wasn’t worth it.

Zuelong features an impressive base speed stat of 119 making it one of the fastest Loomians without the need of a boost. Furthermore, it has a satisfactory Ranged Attack stat at 106. Its energy stat sits at 88 allowing it to reach a reasonable benchmark so it can fire off enough moves.

On the other hand, it does have 3 weaknesses being light, earth and ancient.","However, it is the offensive effectiveness that most people are interested in. Taking in account its relevant ranged attacks, it can hit a broad selection of Loomians for at least neutral effectiveness.",a(5476),"Despite having a great base speed stat, the meta is only becoming faster with it seeing Loomians faster than ever with boots, moves and abilities. For this reason, it’s recommended to run Nimble, enabling it to outspeed offensive threats like Hunder, Jetwing Stratusoar and Chienta.","Additionally, Zuelong appreciates having some damage increase given its output would be lacklustre without it. For this reason, it can run Smart too. As for its negative personality, Very Frail is more than enough given it won’t run melee moves.",a(5636),"Awakening is a great ability boosting Zuelong’s type-sharing moves by an additional 25% however Brute Force is marginally better, granted it removes secondary effects such as a potential burn from Elemental Burst. Despite this, being able to knock out opponents is better than the probability of inflicting an ailment.","For a considerable amount of time, Zuelong didn’t necessarily have a full moveset to run, but it now has quite a few options. The main three moves it should have is Thunderstrike, Elemental Burst and Fire Breath however its last move can be Ancient Roar - to pivot on Loomians it doesn’t like staying on whilst decreasing their offensive presence; Zip-Zap - acting as an alternative pivot move that deals marginal damage and Jolt enabling Zuelong to jump priority to finish off Loomians that may be faster otherwise.

Its Melee Attack sits at 94 while its Ranged attack is 43. Both of its defences are not exactly abundant with its Melee Defence and Ranged Defence being 83 and 69 respectively. This isn’t a huge hindrance considering Hunder is used offensively (and has the speed to avoid being outsped). Hunder’s energy is 84 which allows it to feasibly reach the 250 benchmark. Finally its Health is 78 which is quite “middle in the pack” however this isn’t a big matter.",a(1535),"Hunder is a Metal (like most Sepharite City Loomians) and Electric type which means it has a quad weakness to Earth and a normal weakness to Fire, Water and Brawler.

It also has 2 major resistances being Metal and Air.",a(7685),"Offensively, on the contrary, taking into account its relevant moves, Hunder can hit nearly every Loomian for at least neutral save for a couple of fire types.","Given Hunder is a Melee Attacker, it makes sense to use the positive personality Brawny. However, despite its already great speed stat, it does sit between other Loomians who would want to outspeed Hunder who either have the same speed stat or are only slightly below. For this reason, its highly recommended to run Nimble","As for the negative ability, Very Clumsy will be used due to its uselessness.","Hunder’s Melee Attack is decent for the most part however it can be improved so an ability that increases damage output would be greatly helpful. Brute Force does increase damage output by 30% at the cost of secondary effects but Power Jaw takes this a step further by increasing damage by 50% for all biting moves. For this reason, and also because a lot of Hunder’s best moves are biting-based, we will use Power Jaw.",a(4700),"As mentioned previously, Hunder has a lot of biting moves such as Blaze Chomp, Vice Jaws, Thunder Chomp etc. The specific combination we’ll choose is Vice Jaws, Thunder Chomp, Chilly Chomp and Blaze Chomp.","Vice Jaws prevents the target from using the same move for more than two moves and acts as one of Hunder’s ATB moves. Thunder Chomp enables Hunder to hit water types as well as other metal types. Chilly Chomp is extremely helpful against Earth types as Hunder is 4x weak to them. Finally, Blaze Chomp helps hit dark types, metal types who have an electric immunity and generally any Loomian that doesn’t get hit by the other 3 moves.",a(9690),"Hunder follows the simple “200 200 100” pattern by having 200 Melee Attack, 200 Speed, 52 Energy and 48 Health.

Given these two stats are below mediocre, we can afford to decrease them further.","Alternatively, we could utilize Clever in order to check Cephalops, Ikazune and many other ranged attackers that Barblast can hit for super effectiveness. However, for this demonstration, we’ll be sticking with Very Robust.","To increase the damage output from its 89 Ranged Attack, High Explosive boosts Barblast’s explosive moves (such as Toxiblast and Water Bomb) by 50%. There is a downside to this ability where secondary effects are removed - similar to brute force - but this isn’t a massive downside.",a(6368),"Toxic Spines, an ability that gives the chance for an attacker to be poisoned when using a contact move on Barblast, can also be used however some may find the odds of this ability not worth it. We’ll go ahead with the Secret Ability. ","Barblast isn’t short of moves when it comes to its movepool. Since we are using High Explosive, Toxiblast and Water Bomb are the most obvious choices for ATB. Because This is a defensive loomian, recovery is a must. Rejuvenate will be chosen because of the high amount of health it can return. Finally, for the fourth move, various utility moves can be used but - disappointingly - we can’t choose them all. Poison helps cripple and break down Loomians who stand in Barblast’s way while Icicle Traps help exert pressure due to limiting swap-ins. Power Focus allows Barblast to set up allowing it to hit harder and make it less likely to hit weakly. This set will use Power Focus however any of the three are valid",a(9379),"200 Health and 200 Melee Defense naturally seems the way to go with Barblast given how Melee Bulky we want it to be, allowing it to soak up as much damage as possible from previously mentioned melee attackers.","Despite a somewhat suboptimal energy stat, we can invest 60 Training Points into Energy to reach 250 Total Points which enables Barblast to use 3 Rejuvenates, 3 Water Bombs and 1 Toxiblast. 250 is a great benchmark energy stats so this strategy can be applied to a plethora of Loomians. ","As for the remaining 40 TPs, we can insert them into the Ranged Defense stat in order to increase our bulk on the less defensive side; investing into the Ranged Attack stat is also an option.",a(155),"There’s a few options to our disposal when it comes to what Barblast will be holding. Energy Orb is very helpful to conserve energy and reduce the energy cost of your moves, especially since Barblast will click Rejuvenate, a move with 72 energy cost, quite often. If preserving energy isn’t a worry for you, Heavy Armour helps strengthen Barblast’s Melee Defense. This will hinder your energy stat leading to only 3 Rejuvenates being available at 250 energy so keep this in mind.","Relating to the type effectiveness section, Barblast can find itself in tricky matchups while being able to hit the opponent super effectively i.e. Ikazune, Harvesect and Cephalops. In these situations, the respective pearl - which halves the strength of a move of the corresponding type - can enable Barblast to sustain itself and win in a 1v1.
